# Minimum-in-Rotated-Sorted-Array
Suppose an array of integers sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).  You are given a rotated sorted array nums of unique integers. Write a function to find the minimum element in the array.
